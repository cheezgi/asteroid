For the moment, Model cannot own a GraphicsPipeline:
* Vulkano uses a macro to create a struct implementing GraphicsPipeline
    * which requires access to a Device
    * so it cannot be a module-level invocation
* Vulkano also uses a macro to create shader modules that
    * have an input and output structs implementing ShaderInterfaceDef which
        * have an iter for both input and output
    * as well as a struct implementing PipelineLayoutDesc
    * for both the vertex and fragment shaders (5 structs each, 10 total)

If we want to allow per-model shaders, we would need to write eleven structs
that cover the majority of use cases.
